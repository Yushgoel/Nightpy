---------------------------------------------------------------

The HDF-EOS To GeoTIFF Conversion Tool (HEG) is a tool developed 
to allow a user to reformat, re-project and perform 
stitching/mosaicing and subsetting operations on HDF-EOS 
objects.  The output GeoTIFF file is ingestible into commonly 
used GIS applications. HEG will also write to HDF-EOS Grid & SWATH formats 
(i.e. for Subsetting purposes) and native (or raw) 
binary.  HEG presently works with MODIS (AQUA and TERRA), ASTER, 
MISR, AIRS, and AMSR-E HDF-EOS data sets, Some HDF-EOS5 grids such as OMI, 
SMAP L3/L4 HDF5 EASE2 grid, some VIIRS L2 & L3, SRTM binary data, and 
MOPITT(MOP03JM) products. Please see full list of supported products 
in HEG web site.

New Features/problem fixes for v2.8:
------------------------------------
1) Addition of Albers Projection.


New Features/problem fixes for v2.7:
------------------------------------
1) Support for AMSR-E L3 GRID products in Polar Stereographic
   and EASE-Grid projections.


New Features/problem fixes for v2.6:
------------------------------------
1) Support for all AMSR-E L2 SWATH products and AMSR-E L3 GRID
   (in Geographic projection).
2) Correction for ASTER DEM products.  Presently, the sides of
   the output GeoTIFF image are cut off due to missing data in 
   the internal geolocation fields of the ASTER DEMs.
   Since the geolocations are in a path-oriented UTM GRID (even
   though it's a SWATH product), the missing geolocations could
   then be accurately interpolated.
3) New "Subsetter" functionality for Parameters (aka Fields).
   This results in:
   a) Output to HDF-EOS SWATH from input HDF-EOS SWATH (i.e. for
      ASTER SWATH, MODIS SWATH).
      This allows for output data which is unaltered from a
      projection operation - for input of HDF-EOS SWATH data. 
   b) Output to HDF-EOS GRID from input HDF-EOS GRID without any
      projection operation or altering of input data.
 
   "Subsetter" functionality allows for the creation of
   smaller data sets from large input HDF-EOS SWATH or GRID
   data sets. (Many HDF-EOS data granules are quite large.)
   This is done by selecting a smaller selection of Fields
   from the full list available in the input. A NO_REPROJECTION   
   option is performed so that output data values are unaltered 
   from the input.

   "Subsetter" functionality can also be used in combination
   with reprojection, spatial subsetting, pixel size 
   manipulation, etc.

4) Output of Multi-Band HDFEOS data sets (multiple bands in one
   output HDF-EOS file; previously, HEG only outputs one
   band/field per HDF-EOS output file).  Multiple bands are
   placed in one Object in the HDF-EOS data set.

5) Support of HDF-EOS data which has slight (but important)
   discrepancies in the HDF-EOS standard:

   - Support for MOD43C1, MOD43C2, MOD43C3, MCD43C1, MCD43C2,
     MCD43C3, MOD12C1, MYD12C1,  
     These data sets incorrectly define the corner points of the
     GRID in DD instead of DMS units.  
     HDF-EOS readers will not be able to read these data unless
     they make modifications for this non-standard compliance.
   - Support of MOD11_L2.  These data use incorrect fillvalues
     in the Lat/Lon geolocations.
     The data incorrectly uses -999.0 when the internal metadata
     specifies that fillvalues are -999.9.

6) Support for AIRS L3 products (in Geographic projection).
7) Support for MISR L3 products (in Geographic projection).

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE HEG SOFTWARE:

There are two ways to install HEG on your system:
1. Run the install script
2. Manually install HEG

IMPORTANT: Before installing HEG, make sure you have Java 1.8 or 
greater installed on your system.

1. RUNNING THE INSTALL SCRIPT
------------------------------
* Uncompress and extract the files contained in the tar file.

gunzip hegLNX64v2.15.tar.gz
tar -xvf hegLNX64v2.15.tar
     OR
gunzip hegMACv2.15.tar.gz
tar -xvf hegMACv2.15.tar

NOTE: Once the install script runs, it will automatically remove 
heg<LNX/MAC>.tar from your current directory. If you want to
backup this file, now is the time to do so. 

* Run the install script

  ./install

  NOTE: The install script will ask you a series of questions to 
  assist you in installing HEG on your system

* Once HEG is installed, go to the directory in which you  
  installed HEG, go to the bin directory, and invoke the HEG 
  script to load up the HEG GUI.

For example, if HEG is installed in /home/bob/heg,

cd /home/bob/heg/bin
./HEG

* ENJOY!


2. MANUALLY INSTALL HEG
------------------------
Make a heg directory in your home directory:

cd $HOME
mkdir heg

Change to the heg directory and copy the tar file to that location.

cd heg
mv (location of tar file/heg<LNX64/MAC>v2.15.tar.gz .

Uncompress and extract the files contained in the tar file.

gunzip hegLNX64v2.15.tar.gz
tar -xvf hegLNX64v2.15.tar
     OR
gunzip hegMACv2.15.tar.gz
tar -xvf hegMACv2.15.tar

After uncompressing and extracting, you will get two files, install and heg.tar. 
Ignore the install file.

Extract the files contained in the heg.tar file and start HEG.

tar -xvf heg.tar

cd bin
./HEG

HEG has been installed and should be running.

NOTE: If you are having problems starting HEG (when typing HEG
 on the command line, then check that the directory path to JAVA
 on the local machine is correct. Also, check that the paths in
 the environment variables are correct.


Installation on Windows WINDOWS 7, and 10
---------------------------------------------

1.  Place appropriate zip file hegWINv2.15.zip in a directory that
    does NOT HAVE SPACES in the directory pathname.  HEG will be
    installed under this path tree.
2.  Install java (jdk1.8.* (jre8) or newer windows version).
3.  Unzip hegWINv2.15.zip to the current directory. 
4.  Double click on install.bat and follow the instruction in
    MS-DOS window that appears. 
5.  A file HEGTool.bat will be created by the installation in
    HEG\HEG_Win\bin directory. 
6.  Go to this bin directory, where HEGTool.bat file is, and
    right click on HEGTool.bat. Click on the Create Shortcut. 
    You can change the icon for this shortcut as in step 7.
7.  Right click on the HEGTool.bat Shortcut. Click on the
    Properties and then click on the Change Icon. Now click on
    Browse and select the file "heg.ico" in the HEG_Win\bin
    directory.
8.  To run HEG Double click on the created shortcut(s) or the
    HEGTool.bat in the HEG_Win\bin directory.
